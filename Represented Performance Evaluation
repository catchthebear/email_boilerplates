Subject: Performance Review

Hi XXX,

As you know, the campus recently opened the request for Performance Reviews. I'll be scheduling our one-on-one meeting soon, so please keep an eye out for that.

Attached is last year's form for your review.

I'd appreciate it if you could share some input on goals you'd like us to consider when we meet.

Thanks,

XXXX

Hi XXXXX,

Attached is your performance evaluation for 2023-2024.

As we discussed in our meeting, please look over the form and make any comments in the "Employee Comments" section.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Also, if you could kindly return this by September 20th this would be appreciated.

Thank you for your support,

Robert
